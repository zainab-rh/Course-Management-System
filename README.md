# Introduction 
This project is a third-year Computer Engineering project developed as part of the Software Engineering course. The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient system for managing university courses, including assigning teachers and classrooms, and enrolling students.

The project aims to streamline administrative tasks, such as scheduling and assigning resources to courses, while ensuring that scheduling conflicts and capacity issues are minimized.

This project is designed to reduce manual work for administrators and improve the accuracy and efficiency of course management.

# Features
